        PhaseHalfPiNeon.h
        Author: Laurent de Soras, 2016

From the input signal, generates two signals with a pi/2 phase shift, using
NEON instruction set.

This object must be aligned on a 16-byte boundary!

If the number of coefficients is 2 or 3 modulo 4, the output is delayed from
1 sample, compared to the theoretical formula (or FPU implementation).

Template parameters:
	- NC: number of coefficients, > 0
