Compute coefficients for 2-path polyphase IIR filter, half-band filter or
Pi/2 phaser.

                      -2
               a   + z
         N/2-1  2k
A0 (z) = Prod  ----------
         k = 0         -2
               1 + a  z
                    2k

                              -2
                     a     + z
          -1 (N-1)/2  2k+1
A1 (z) = z  . Prod   ------------
              k = 0            -2
                     1 + a    z
                          2k+1

        1
H (z) = - (A0 (z) + A1 (z))
        2

Sum of A0 and A1 gives a low-pass filter.
Difference of A0 and A1 gives the complementary high-pass filter.

For the Pi/2 phaser, product form is (a - z^-2) / (1 - az^-2)
Sum and difference of A0 and A1 have a Pi/2 phase difference.
